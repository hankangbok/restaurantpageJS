# restaurantpageJS
Making a restaurant homepage and practicing nodejs, webpack, js, html

View the simulated page at this address: https://kyouyatamax.github.io/restaurantpageJS/

Future Fixes/Plans:
- The code is REAL messy for this solution, although functional.
- I will clean up the code and condense it.
- The header bar should collapse down for 'mobile' sized windows. Need to add this feature.
